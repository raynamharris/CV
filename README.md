# CV and Resume

This repo contains a pdf of my [CV](./CV.pdf) and [resume](./Resume.pdf). 
Both were made with Overleaf, and the source code is available in the CV and Resume directories.

An (out-of-date) markdown version of my CV is available on my website at [https://www.raynamharris.com/CV/](https://www.raynamharris.com/CV/).

A fancy autogenearted form of my CV is available at [CV-RMH.pdf](./CV-RMH.pdf).
